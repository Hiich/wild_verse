          excels in both departments

                  DJ W!LD has gone from being a cult favourite of the Paris
                  underground to a globally recognised house talent. Blending
                  house, minimal, techno, acid, he is on a constant tour of the
                  world’s finest clubs and festivals : Circoloco, Tomorrowland,
                  Burning man, Cocoon, and lately Solid Grooves. He’s surely one
                  of the most prolific producers around with an extensive
                  discography of more than 300+ tracks released backing his
                  formidable DJing skills

          W!LD is today offering a glimpse of his life through NFT’s. These
          virtual art pieces will be presented through collections, underlying
          every part of Wild’s life, giving you the ability to understand each
          and very personality of the artist.<br></br>By constantly put into
          boxes, W!LD always refused to be categorised, making it very difficult
          for him to show the world all of his arts in one. The mixture of
          different talents and influences through times made him one of the
          last major artists from these days, merging Parisian elegance,
          Couture, street sexiness and underground music. Considering himself as
          a schizophrenic, he is realising his personalities through collection,
          each of them allowing the collector to tap into the inside world of
          W!LDVERSE.
